Project Overview
Multiverse Language School is an interactive language learning platform designed for users across different devices. The platform features:

Web Application built using Flutter Web.
Mobile Application built using Flutter for iOS and Android.
Backend for user authentication, course management, progress tracking, and more.
Flutter is used for both web and mobile to ensure consistent performance and design across platforms.

Features
Cross-Platform Experience: One codebase for both web and mobile apps (iOS and Android) using Flutter.
User Authentication: Secure login system with support for email/password, and social login.
Multilingual Support: Offers various languages to learn such as English, Spanish, French, German, etc.
Interactive Lessons: Multimedia lessons, quizzes, and exercises to engage learners.
Real-Time Progress Sync: User progress is synchronized across all platforms (web and mobile).
Offline Support: Mobile app supports offline functionality to continue learning without internet access.
Progress Tracking: Real-time tracking of course progress and learning milestones.
Technologies Used
This project uses the following technologies:

Flutter:

Flutter for both the Web and Mobile App development (iOS and Android).
Dart for writing Flutter applications.
Backend:

Node.js with Express.js (or Django) for the backend API.
MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL) for database management.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
Hosting & Infrastructure:

Firebase for real-time database, push notifications, and analytics.
AWS (or DigitalOcean) for backend and database hosting.
Docker for containerization of backend services.
Cloudflare for CDN and security.
System Architecture
The architecture follows a client-server model with the following components:

Frontend (Web + Mobile):

Flutter is used to develop both the web and mobile apps. The same codebase serves the web platform, as well as iOS and Android mobile platforms.
The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs or GraphQL.
Backend:

The backend is responsible for user authentication, managing courses and lessons, storing progress data, and handling payments.
REST APIs or GraphQL serve as the interface between the backend and frontend.
Database:

A NoSQL database (MongoDB) or relational database (PostgreSQL) stores user data, courses, lessons, quizzes, and progress tracking.
Real-Time Sync:

Firebase is used for real-time synchronization of user data and progress between devices.
